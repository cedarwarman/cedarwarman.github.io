He studies plant sexual reproduction in the lab of Dr. Ravishankar Palanivelu. Cedar is interested in high-throughput phenotyping, computational biology, and data science. He works to combine computational methods with basic plant biology to answer fundamental questions about how plant reproduction is affected by envronmental stress.
