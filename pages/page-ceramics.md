			I have been practicing ceramics for the past three years, including at the <a href="https://www.tucsonclayco-op.com/">Tucson Clay Co-op</a> and at <a href="https://www.odysseyclayworks.com/">Odyssey Clayworks</a> in Asheville, NC. First and foremost I am a tea drinker, so my goal is to create functional teaware that feels good in hands and is nice to look at. I hope to continue my exploration of clay by learning more about form, glazes, and firing. Here are some of the things I've made.
